    You are an expert instructional designer. Build a professional "learning routine" mind map for ADHD learners as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from the material below.
    Material:
    ${topic}

    Strict goals:
    - Generate 8–12 total nodes.
    - Exactly 1 root (start) and exactly 1 terminal (end) node.
    - Graph must be a clean DAG: no cycles, no back-edges, no dangling nodes.
    - Every non-root node has at least 1 incoming edge; every non-terminal node has at least 1 outgoing edge.
    - Edges only connect from layer Li to Li+1 (no skips or cross-layer edges).

    ADHD-friendly learning routine layers (top to bottom):
    - L0 Start (1 node): Overview & goals.
    - L1 Foundations (1–2 nodes): prerequisites or key reminders.
    - L2 Core concepts (3–5 nodes): small, digestible chunks in logical order.
    - L3 Practice/Apply (2–3 nodes): tiny exercises or applications.
    - L4 Review/Check/Wrap-up (1–2 nodes): self-check, recap, next steps; terminal is here.

    Labels and IDs:
    - Use concise 3–6 word labels with a numeric prefix to signal sequence, e.g. "1. Overview & goals", "2. Immutability basics".
    - Use sequential node ids: n1, n2, ..., nK, where n1 is the root and the last id is the terminal.

    Layout constraints (absolute positions):
    - Top-to-bottom layered layout. Assign fixed y per layer to prevent overlap:
      L0: y=40, L1: y=140, L2: y=260, L3: y=380, L4: y=500.
    - x positions spread evenly within 40–760 range. Maintain ≥120px between nodes on the same layer.
    - Keep all coordinates within x: 0–800, y: 0–600.

    Edge rules:
    - Connect from each node in Li to the node(s) in Li+1 that directly depend on it.
    - No crossovers to non-adjacent layers; no parallel random links.

    Output strictly as JSON that conforms to the provided schema (nodes, edges only; no extra fields, no markdown).
    Ensure the result is fully connected from n1 (root) down to the terminal node placed in L4.
